HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames to allow HTTP servers to reliably specify their Client
Hint preferences, with minimal performance overhead.

# Introduction

{{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}} defines a response header,
Accept-CH, for servers to advertise a set of request headers used for proactive
content negotiation. This allows user agents to send request headers only when
used, improving their performance overhead as well as reducing passive
fingerprinting surface.

However, on the first HTTP request to a server, the user agent will not have
received the Accept-CH header and may not take the server preferences into
account. More generally, the server's configuration may have changed since the
most recent HTTP request to the server. This document defines a pair of
mechanisms to resolve this:

1. an HTTP response header, Critical-CH, for the server to instruct the user
   agent to retry the request

2. an alternate delivery mechanism for Accept-CH in HTTP/2 {{RFC7540}} and
   HTTP/3 {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}}, which can avoid the performance hit of a
   retry in most cases

# The Critical-CH Response Header Field {#critical-ch}

When a user agent requests a resource based on a missing or outdated Accept-CH
value, it may not send a desired request header field. Neither user agent nor server
has enough information to reliably and efficiently recover from this situation.
The server can observe that the header is missing, but the user agent may not have
supported the header, or may have chosen not to send it. Triggering a new
request in these cases would risk an infinite loop or an unnecessary round-trip.

Conversely, the user agent can observe that a request header appears in the
Accept-CH (Section 3.1 of {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}}) and Vary (Section
7.1.4 of {{RFC7231}}) response header fields. However, retrying based on this
information would waste resources if the resource only used the Client Hint as
an optional optimization.

This document introduces critical Client Hints. These are the Client Hints which
meaningfully change the resulting resource. For example, a server may use the
Device-Memory Client Hint {{DEVICE-MEMORY}} to select simple and complex variants
of a resource to different user agents. Such a resource should be fetched
consistently across page loads to avoid jarring user-visible switches.

The server specifies critical Client Hints with the Critical-CH response header
field. It is a Structured Header {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} whose
value MUST be an sf-list (Section 3.1 of {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}})
whose members are tokens (Section 3.3.4 of
{{I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}). Its ABNF is:

~~~
  Critical-CH = sf-list
~~~

For example:

~~~
  Critical-CH: Sec-CH-Example, Sec-CH-Example-2
~~~

Each token listed in the Critical-CH header SHOULD additionally be present in
the Accept-CH and Vary response headers.

When a user agent receives an HTTP response containing a Critical-CH header,
it first processes the Accept-CH header as described in Section 3.1 of
{{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}}. It then performs the following steps:

1. If the request did not use a safe method (Section 4.2.1 of {{RFC7231}}), ignore the Critical-CH header and continue processing the response as usual.

2. If the response was already the result of a retry, ignore the Critical-CH header and continue processing the response as usual.

3. Determine the Client Hints that would have been sent given the updated Accept-CH value, incorporating the user agent's local policy and user preferences. See also Section 2.1 of {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}}.

4. Compare this result to the Client Hints which were sent. If any Client Hint listed in the Critical-CH header was not previously sent and would now have been sent, retry the request with the new preferences. Otherwise, continue processing the response as usual.

Note this procedure does not cause the user agent to send Client Hints it would
not otherwise send.

## Example

For example, if the user agent loads https://example.com with no knowledge of
the server's Accept-CH preferences, it may send the following response:

~~~
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Example, Sec-CH-Example-2
  Vary: Sec-CH-Example
  Critical-CH: Sec-CH-Example
~~~

In this example, the server, across the whole origin, uses both Sec-CH-Example
and Sec-CH-Example-2 Client Hints. However, this resource only uses
Sec-CH-Example, which it considers critical.

The user agent now processes the Accept-CH header and determines it would have
sent both headers. Sec-CH-Example is listed in Critical-CH, so the user agent
retries the request, and receives a more specific response.

~~~
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Sec-CH-Example: 1
  Sec-CH-Example-2: 2

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Example, Sec-CH-Example-2
  Vary: Sec-CH-Example
  Critical-CH: Sec-CH-Example
~~~


# The ACCEPT_CH Frame

While Critical-CH header provides reliability, it requires a retry on some
requests. This document additionally introduces the ACCEPT_CH HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
frames as an optimization so the server's Client Hint preferences are usually
available before the client's first request.

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers which request Client Hints SHOULD send an ACCEPT_CH
frame as early as possible. Connections using TLS {{RFC8446}} which negotiate the
Application Layer Protocol Settings (ALPS) {{I-D.vvv-tls-alps}} extension
SHOULD include the ACCEPT_CH frame in the ALPS value as described in
{{I-D.vvv-httpbis-alps}}. This ensures the information is available to the
user agent when it makes the first request.

\[\[TODO: Alternatively, is it time to revive
draft-bishop-httpbis-extended-settings?\]\]


## HTTP/2 ACCEPT_CH Frame

The HTTP/2 ACCEPT_CH frame type is TBD (decimal TBD) and contains zero or more entries, each consisting of a pair of length-delimited strings:

~~~
+-------------------------------+
|         Origin-Len (16)       |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|         Origin                                              ...
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|         Value-Len (16)        |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|         Value                                               ...
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
~~~

The fields are defined as follows:

Origin-Len:
: An unsigned, 16-bit integer indicating the length, in octets, of the Origin field.

Origin:
: A sequence of characters containing the ASCII serialization of an origin (Section 6.2 of {{RFC6454}}) that the sender is providing an Accept-CH value for.

Value-Len:
: An unsigned, 16-bit integer indicating the length, in octets, of the Value field.

Value:
: A sequence of characters containing the Accept-CH value for the corresponding origin. This value MUST satisfy the Accept-CH ABNF defined in Section 3.1 of {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}}.

Clients MUST NOT send ACCEPT_CH frames. Servers which receive an ACCEPT_CH
frame MUST respond with a connection error (Section 5.4.1 of {{RFC7540}}) of type
PROTOCOL_ERROR.

ACCEPT_CH frames always apply to a single connection, never a single stream. The
stream identifier in the ACCEPT_CH frame MUST be zero. The flags field of an
ACCEPT_CH field is unused and MUST be zero. If a user agent receives an
ACCEPT_CH frame whose stream identifier or flags field is non-zero, it MUST
respond with a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

## HTTP/3 ACCEPT_CH Frame

The HTTP/3 ACCEPT_CH frame type is TBD (decimal TBD) and contains zero or more
entries, each containing an origin and a corresponding Accept-CH value.

~~~
HTTP/3 ACCEPT_CH Entry {
  Origin Length (i),
  Origin (..)
  Value Length (i),
  Value (..),
}

HTTP/3 ACCEPT_CH Frame {
  Type (i) = TBD,
  Length (i),
  HTTP/3 ACCEPT_CH Entry (..) ...,
}
~~~

The fields of each HTTP/3 ACCEPT_CH Entry are defined as follows:

Origin Length:
: A variable-length integer containing the length, in bytes, of the Origin field.

Origin:
: A sequence of characters containing the ASCII serialization of an origin (Section 6.2 of {{RFC6454}}) that the sender is providing an Accept-CH value for.

Value Length:
: A variable-length integer containing the length, in bytes, of the Value field.

Value:
: A sequence of characters containing the Accept-CH value for the corresponding origin. This value MUST satisfy the Accept-CH ABNF defined in Section 3.1 of {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}}.

Clients MUST NOT send ACCEPT_CH frames. Servers which receive an ACCEPT_CH
frame MUST respond with a connection error (Section 8 of {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}})
of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

ACCEPT_CH frames may only be sent on the control stream. Clients which receive
an ACCEPT_CH frame on any other stream MUST respond with a connection error of
type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

## Processing ACCEPT_CH Frames {#processing-accept-ch-frames}

The user agent remembers the most recently received ACCEPT_CH frame for each
HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connection. When it receives a new ACCEPT_CH frame, either in
application data or ALPS, it overwrites this value. As this is an optimization,
the user agent MAY bound the size and ignore or forget entries to reduce
resource usage.

When the user agent makes an HTTP request to a particular origin over an HTTP/2
or HTTP/3 connection, it looks up the origin in the remembered ACCEPT_CH, if
any. If it finds a match, it determines additional Client Hints to send,
incorporating its local policy and user preferences. See Section 2.1 of
{{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}}.

If there are additional Client Hints, the user agent restarts the request with
updated headers. The connection has already been established, so this restart
does not incur any additional network latency. Note it may result in a different
secondary HTTP cache key (see Section 4.1 of {{RFC7234}}) and select a different
cached response. If the new cached response does not need revalidation, it may
not use the connection at all.

User agents MUST NOT process Client Hint preferences in ACCEPT_CH frames
corresponding to origins for which the connection is not authoritative. Note the
procedure above implicitly satisfies this by deferring processing to after the
connection has been chosen for a corresponding request. Unauthoritative origins
and other unmatched entries are ignored.

\[\[TODO: Some variations on this behavior we could choose instead:

* Do new ACCEPT_CH frames override the whole set or implement some kind of update? Overriding the whole set seems simplest and most consistent with an EXTENDED_SETTINGS variant.

* Should the user agent reject the ACCEPT_CH frame if there are unexpected origins in there? Deferring avoids needing to worry about this, and ignoring the unused ones may interact better with secondary certs.

* Should ACCEPT_CH frames be deferred or just written to the cache when received? Deferred simplifies reasoning about bad origins, predictive connections, etc., but means interactions between ACCEPT_CH and Accept-CH are more complex (see below).

* How should ACCEPT_CH and Accept-CH interact? The document currently proposes unioning them, which is easy. Accept-CH first would work, but unnecessarily ignore newer connection-level ACCEPT_CHs. ACCEPT_CH would not; a stale connection-level preference would get stuck. Whichever is received earlier would also work, but requires tracking timestamps if deferred (see above).\]\]


## Interaction with Critical-CH

The ACCEPT_CH frame avoids a round-trip, so relying on it over Critical-CH would
be preferable. However, this is not always possible:

* The server may be running older software without support for ACCEPT_CH or
  ALPS.

* The server's Accept-CH preferences may change while existing connections are
  open. Those connections will have outdated ACCEPT_CH frames. While the server
  could send a new frame, it may not arrive in time for the next request.
  Moreover, if the HTTP serving frontend is an intermediary like a CDN, it may
  not be proactively notified of origin server changes.

* HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 allow connection reuse across multiple origins (Section
  9.1.1 of {{RFC7540}} and Section 3.4 of {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}}). Some origins
  may not be listed in the ACCEPT_CH frame, particularly if the server used a
  wildcard X.509 certificate.

Thus this document defines both mechanisms. Critical-CH provides reliable
Client
Hint delivery, while the ACCEPT_CH frame avoids the retry in most cases.


# Security Considerations

Request header fields may expose sensitive information about the user's
environment. Section 4.1 of {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints}} discusses some of
these considerations. The document augments the capabilities of Client Hints,
but does not change these considerations. The procedure described in
{{critical-ch}} does not result in the user agent sending request headers it
otherwise would not have.

The ACCEPT_CH frame does introduce a new way for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connections to
make assertions about origins they are not authoritative for, but the procedure
in  {{processing-accept-ch-frames}} defers processing until after the user agent
has decided to use the connection for a particular request (Section 9.1.1 of
{{RFC7540}} and Section 3.4 of {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}}). The user agent will thus
only use information from an ACCEPT_CH frame if it considers the connection
authoritative for the origin.


# IANA Considerations

This specification adds an entry to the "HTTP/2 Frame Type" registry {{RFC7540}}
with the following parameters:

* Frame Type: ACCEPT_CH

* Code: TBD

* Allowed in ALPS: Yes

* Reference: \[\[this document\]\]

This specification adds an entry to the "HTTP/3 Frame Type" registry
{{I-D.ietf-quic-http}} with the following parameters:

* Frame Type: ACCEPT_CH

* Code: TBD

* Allowed in ALPS: Yes

* Reference: \[\[this document\]\]

\[\[TODO: As of writing, the Frame Type registries do not include
Allowed in ALPS columns, but {{I-D.vvv-httpbis-alps}} adds them. This document
should be updated as that design evolves.\]\]
